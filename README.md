Developed a functional clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time and updates dynamically in real-time. HTML was used to structure the basic elements of the clock, while CSS was applied to style the clock for a clean and visually appealing design. JavaScript handles the real-time functionality by fetching the current time and updating the display every second, ensuring the clock remains accurate.
